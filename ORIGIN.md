# Why hAIvemind exists

No single free model is as good as a paid frontier model. But several free models critiquing each other might be.

## The premise

Give two different models the same problem — one catches a bug the other misses. Do that with five models and you cover far more ground than any individual. The intelligence emerges from the interaction, not from any single participant.

## The theory

Instead of routing to the "best" model or using a paid arbiter to judge outputs, put all the models in a shared space and let consensus emerge naturally:

1. Every model sees the same prompt and every other model's previous answer
2. Each model independently verifies, critiques, and builds on what it reads
3. Models adopt whatever role the conversation needs — critic, builder, skeptic, synthesizer — fluidly, not by assignment
4. When drafts converge, the room agrees. That's the answer.

The analogy is a room full of people who can't leave until they solve the problem. Nobody is the boss. They read the whiteboard, argue, concede when outnumbered, and the document gets better until everyone stops editing.

## What matters

- **Coverage over intelligence** — diverse models catch different things
- **No arbiter** — consensus is emergent, not judged
- **Shared memory** — all state lives on disk where every model can read it
- **Fluid roles** — fixed roles get gamed; letting models improvise produces more honest debate
- **The prompt is the product** — the room rules that create social dynamics between models are the core of the system
